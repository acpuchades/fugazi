# Strategy files

A **strategy file** is the declarative input to the `fugazi run` backtester. It
describes one [`SingleAssetStrategy`](../src/strategies/single_asset.rs): a traded
symbol plus the boolean signals that open and close its long/short positions. The
file is a YAML mirror of the library's composition API — every tag maps
one-to-one to a fugazi constructor — so a strategy you can write in Rust by
nesting constructors you can also write in a file, and vice versa.

```sh
fugazi run @strategy.yml --series @candles.csv --output-dir out/
```

The strategy is the positional argument and follows the `@` convention the data
flags use: `@file.yml` loads a file, anything else is treated as
inline content (handy for one-offs, e.g. `'{ symbol: BTC, long: { enter: !crosses_above { lhs: !sma { period: 3 }, rhs: !sma { period: 8 } } } }'`).

> YAML surface is pending.

## Format: tags, maps, and bare words

The document deserializes into a tree of **externally-tagged enums**: a source,
signal, or strategy node is identified by a single key naming its kind. There are
two equivalent spellings, and you can mix them freely in one file:

| Spelling | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **YAML tag** | `!sma { source: close, period: 20 }` | the idiomatic form |
| **Map form** | `sma: { source: close, period: 20 }` | a single-key mapping — identical meaning |
| **Bare word** | `close`, `obv` | for a node that takes no parameters |
| **Scalar** | `!value 100`, `!value true` | for a node that wraps a single value |

The tag form and the single-key-map form are interchangeable because the loader
normalizes `!tag value` into `{tag: value}` before typing the document. The bare
word is just the map/tag with no body, used for parameterless leaves (`close`)
and bar indicators (`obv`, `vwap`).

The format is always YAML, in either block or flow (inline) style. JSON is a
subset of YAML, so a JSON-shaped document still parses — it just lands on the map
form throughout, since JSON has no tags: `{"sma": {"source": "close", "period": 20}}`.

### Nesting

Composition *is* nesting. A source's `source`/`lhs`/`rhs` field holds another
source; a logic signal's operands hold other signals. Because each nested node
sits on its own YAML node, it can carry its own tag:

```yaml
enter: !crosses_above
  lhs: !sma { source: close, period: 5 }
  rhs: !sma { source: close, period: 20 }
```

**One caveat:** YAML forbids two tags on a single node, so you cannot write
`!not !below { … }`. For the unary wrappers `!not` and `!changed`, give the inner
signal in map form (or as a nested block):

```yaml
# OK — inner signal in map form
enter: !not { below: { source: !rsi { period: 14 }, level: 30 } }

# also OK — inner signal as a nested block
enter: !not
  below:
    source: !rsi { period: 14 }
    level: 30

# ERROR — two tags on one node
enter: !not !below { source: !rsi { period: 14 }, level: 30 }
```

## Top-level structure

A strategy document is a mapping with these fields (unknown fields are rejected):

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `symbol` | string | — (**required**) | the instrument to trade |
| `long` | side | none | the long entry/exit (see [Sides](#sides)) |
| `short` | side | none | the short entry/exit |

The strategy wires up whichever of `long`/`short` you provide; omitting both
yields a strategy that never trades.

### Sides

A side (`long` or `short`) is a mapping with an entry signal and an optional exit:

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enter` | signal | — (**required**) | open/reverse into the position when this fires |
| `exit` | signal | never fires | flatten the position to flat when this fires |
| `stop_loss` | source | none | a price **level**; flatten when the bar moves adversely through it |
| `take_profit` | source | none | a price **level**; flatten when the bar moves favourably through it |

Entries are all-in and reversal-capable: an opposite-side `enter` reverses an
open position. That is why `exit` **defaults to never-fire** — for an always-in
long/short reversal, the opposite side's `enter` already does the flip, so an
explicit flatten-to-flat exit would be dead. Give a side an `exit` only when you
want a flat rest (long/flat, or long/short with a pause between trades).

#### Protective stops

`stop_loss` and `take_profit` are **price levels** (sources), not signals. For a
long, the `stop_loss` fires when the bar's `low` reaches it and the `take_profit`
when the bar's `high` does (mirrored for a short); the position flattens, filled
at the level — or at the bar's `open` when it gaps past the level (opens already
beyond it). Build the level from the
[position-anchored sources](#position-anchored-sources): `entry` is the entry
price (a fixed stop), `peak` / `trough` the running extreme since entry (a
**trailing** stop, which tracks completed bars and so reacts the bar after a new
extreme). They are checked every bar, so they fire intra-bar, independently of
`enter`/`exit`.

```yaml
# Long on a breakout, with a 5% trailing stop and a fixed 15% take-profit.
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter:       !crosses_above { lhs: close, rhs: !rolling_max { source: high, period: 20 } }
  stop_loss:   !mul { lhs: peak,  rhs: !value 0.95 }   # 5% off the high since entry
  take_profit: !mul { lhs: entry, rhs: !value 1.15 }   # 15% above entry
```

```yaml
# Always-in reversal: no exits needed — each side's enter reverses the other.
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter:  !crosses_above { lhs: !sma { period: 5 }, rhs: !sma { period: 20 } }
short:
  enter:  !crosses_below { lhs: !sma { period: 5 }, rhs: !sma { period: 20 } }
```

```yaml
# Long/flat: an explicit exit returns to flat (no short side).
symbol: AAPL
long:
  enter:  !crosses_above { lhs: !sma { period: 50 }, rhs: !sma { period: 200 } }
  exit:   !crosses_below { lhs: !sma { period: 50 }, rhs: !sma { period: 200 } }
```

#### Trading costs

Costs are configured on the command line — the strategy YAML doesn't spell
them out — so the same strategy can be evaluated against several venue
schedules without editing the spec. See [CLI § `--costs`](CLI.md#--costs)
for the full grammar and the model catalogue; two things worth knowing when
reading a costed `metrics.yml`:

- **Fill pipeline: spread → slippage → commission.** Every fill starts
  from the theoretical trigger price (bar `open` for a market order, the
  trigger level — or the `open` on a gap — for a stop/take-profit), then:
  1. Half-spread is applied — buys pay it, sells receive it.
  2. Slippage is applied — always adverse to the *trading side* (buys slip
     up, sells slip down), regardless of whether the trade opens a fresh
     position or closes an existing one. So a stop-out on a losing short
     doesn't get "free" slippage — the aggressor-side rule matches real
     tape behaviour.
  3. Commission is computed from the *final* price × units and recorded
     separately (`trades.csv`'s `commission` column,
     [`metrics.costs.total_commission`](CLI.md#costs--cost-aggregates)) —
     never netted into `price`.

- **Stop-slippage multiplier.** A triggered stop or take-profit in a fast,
  gapping market realistically slips more than a planned market entry, so
  the two shipped slippage models (`bps`, `volume_participation`) carry a
  `stop_multiplier` field (default `1.5×`) applied on top of the market
  figure when [`OrderKind`](#protective-stops) is `Stop` / `TakeProfit`.
  Set it to `1.0` to model stops as identical to market fills; set it
  higher (`2.0`–`3.0`) for a crypto book with recurrent gap risk.

  This is why costed backtests will typically show a higher cost figure
  for stop-out heavy strategies than a naïve "same slippage for every
  fill" model would — the multiplier is doing its job.

## Sources

A **source** produces a `Real` per bar (`Output = Real`). Any field named
`source`, `lhs`, `rhs`, `high`, or `low` takes one. Where a source has a `source`
field it **defaults to `close`** (and `donchian_*`'s `high`/`low` default to the
`high`/`low` candle fields), so `!sma { period: 20 }` is the SMA of the close.

### Candle-field leaves (bare words)

`close`, `high`, `low`, `open`, `volume`, `typical` (HLC/3), `median` (HL/2).
The whole current bar is `!current` — the default `source:` for every
bar-consuming tag below, and the leaf you name explicitly when composing
cross-timeframe pipelines (`!resample { every: 4, source: !current }`).

### Constant

`!value <n>` — a constant source. (Tuple form: the scalar is the body, e.g.
`!value 100`.)

### Position-anchored sources (bare words)

`entry`, `peak`, `trough`. These read the **current position**, so they are only
meaningful inside a side's `stop_loss` / `take_profit` (or a custom `exit`):

- `entry` — the price the position was opened at (a fixed stop/target anchor);
- `peak` — the running high since entry (a long trailing-stop anchor);
- `trough` — the running low since entry (a short trailing-stop anchor).

They read as `None` (the level is inactive) while flat, and `peak`/`trough`
restart on each new entry.

### Price-series indicators — `{ source = close, period }`

`!sma`, `!ema`, `!rma` (Wilder/SMMA), `!wma`, `!hma` (Hull), `!rsi`, `!stddev`,
`!cci`, `!stochastic`.

`!stoch_rsi { source = close, rsi_period, stoch_period }` — the stochastic of an
RSI.

### Multi-output indicators — one tag per component

Each line of a multi-output indicator is its own source tag:

| Tags | Fields (`source` defaults to `close`) |
| --- | --- |
| `!macd_line`, `!macd_signal`, `!macd_histogram` | `{ source, fast, slow, signal }` |
| `!bb_upper`, `!bb_middle`, `!bb_lower` | `{ source, period, k }` |
| `!keltner_upper`, `!keltner_middle`, `!keltner_lower` | `{ source, candle_source = !current, ema_period, atr_period, multiplier }` |
| `!donchian_upper`, `!donchian_middle`, `!donchian_lower` | `{ high = high, low = low, period }` |
| `!adx`, `!plus_di`, `!minus_di` | `{ period }` (the ADX/DI components) |
| `!dmi_plus_di`, `!dmi_minus_di` | `{ period }` (raw +DI/−DI, no ADX smoothing) |
| `!aroon_up`, `!aroon_down`, `!aroon_oscillator` | `{ period }` |

### Bar indicators (consume the whole candle)

`!atr { period }`, `!mfi { period }`, `!williams_r { period }`,
`!sar { step, max }`; and the parameterless `!obv`, `!vwap`, `!ad`,
`!true_range` (usable as bare words). Each accepts an optional `source:`
field for the underlying candle stream, defaulting to `!current` — set it
when composing across timeframes (e.g. `!atr { period: 14, source:
!resample { every: 4 } }`). The `!keltner_*` tags likewise take an
optional `candle_source:` for the ATR leg (also defaults to `!current`).

### Transforms

| Tags | Fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!add`, `!sub`, `!mul`, `!div` | `{ lhs, rhs }` | arithmetic over two sources (`div` → none on /0) |
| `!lag`, `!diff`, `!ratio`, `!roc` | `{ source = close, periods }` | lookback vs. `periods` bars ago |
| `!rolling_max`, `!rolling_min` | `{ source = close, period }` | rolling extremum over `period` bars |
| `!resample` | `{ every, inner, source = !current }` | aggregate every N candles of `source` (a `Candle`-output stream, defaulting to `!current`) into one higher-timeframe candle and run `inner` (any Real source) over that HTF candle; emits `inner`'s output on each completed bucket and `None` in between. `inner` is **required** — no default |
| `!latch` | `{ source }` | hold the last `Some` output of `source`; `None` before the first arrives |

#### Cross-timeframe composition — `!resample` + `!latch`

There is no dedicated cross-timeframe tag; compose `!resample` and `!latch`
directly. `!resample { every: N, inner: <source> }` runs `inner` over the
higher-timeframe candle emitted every N base bars — `inner: close` projects
the HTF close, `inner: !ema { period: 20, source: close }` runs an EMA-20
that recurses over HTF closes, and so on. The optional `source:` field
selects the base `Candle` stream `every` reads from (defaults to
`!current`). On base ticks in between, the resample emits `None` and any
recursive smoother inside `inner` naturally does not advance. Wrap the
whole resample in `!latch { source }` so per-base-tick reads see the
finished higher-timeframe value between boundaries.

The **only correct ordering** is resample (with the recursive smoother as its
`inner`) → latch: latching *before* the recursive smoother would feed it a
held (repeated) value on every base tick, distorting the recurrence.

```yaml
# Base bars: 1h. Higher timeframe: 4h. Enter long when the 1h close crosses
# above the EMA-20 computed on 4h candles.
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter: !crosses_above
    lhs: close
    rhs: !latch
      source: !resample
        every: 4
        inner: !ema { period: 20, source: close }
```

**The resample's clock stays base-timeframe.** It's fed one base candle per
tick and reports at that same cadence — the emitted `Option<Real>` marks
*whether* the inner just produced a value on a completed bucket. Warm-up and
unstable-period pass through as raw composition arithmetic — higher-timeframe
sample counts, not base-bar-scaled. For an EMA-P over a resample-`every`
chain, `stable_period() = every + settle_period(P)` (not
`every * (1 + settle_period(P))`); if a strategy needs base-bar-correct
stability accounting, it must feed the pipeline enough leading history for
the recursive tail to decay in HTF-sample terms.

## Signals

A **signal** produces a `bool` per bar. Both sides of a strategy take one as
`enter`/`exit`. A signal reads `false` until every source it depends on has warmed
up, so an edge coinciding with warm-up never fires a spurious first-bar trade.

### Comparisons — `{ lhs, rhs, epsilon? }`

`!gt`, `!lt`, `!ge`, `!le`, `!eq`, `!ne` compare two **sources**. `epsilon` is an
optional absolute tolerance (default `1e-8`) so floating-point noise doesn't cause
spurious flips.

### Threshold comparisons — `{ source = close, level }`

`!above` (`source > level`), `!below` (`source < level`) — compare a source
against a constant, the common case of `!gt`/`!lt` against a number.

### Crossovers — `{ lhs, rhs }`

`!crosses_above`, `!crosses_below` — fire on the bar `lhs` crosses over/under
`rhs` (the comparison is true *and* it just changed). Operands are sources.

### Boolean logic

| Tag | Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!and`, `!or`, `!xor` | `{ lhs, rhs }` | combine two **signals** |
| `!all` | `[ … ]` | AND-fold of a list of signals (empty ⇒ always true) |
| `!any` | `[ … ]` | OR-fold of a list of signals (empty ⇒ always false) |
| `!not` | `<signal>` | negation (see the [nesting caveat](#nesting)) |
| `!changed` | `<signal>` | fires on any transition of the inner signal (the edge primitive) |
| `!unstable` | `{ signal: <signal> }` | passthrough wrapper that forces the reported `unstable_period()` to `0` for the wrapped subtree. Opt-in override of the safe-by-default strategy-readiness gate (which waits for every source's `stable_period()` before allowing a trade). A source-side twin `!unstable { source: <source> }` does the same for real-valued sources. |
| `!value` | `<bool>` | a constant boolean leaf — `!value true` / `!value false` (same tag as the numeric `!value`; typed by position) |

```yaml
# A compound entry: EMA crossover, gated by RSI not being overbought.
enter: !all
  - !crosses_above { lhs: !ema { period: 12 }, rhs: !ema { period: 26 } }
  - !below { source: !rsi { period: 14 }, level: 70 }
```

## Parameters — `!param`

Any value in the document can be a **placeholder** resolved at run time with
`--params`, so one file covers many variations (periods, thresholds, the traded
symbol) without editing:

```yaml
symbol: !param { key: SYM, default: BTC }
long:
  enter: !crosses_above
    lhs: !sma { source: close, period: !param { key: FAST } }              # required
    rhs: !sma { source: close, period: !param { key: SLOW, default: 8 } }  # optional
```

- `!param { key: NAME }` — **required**; a missing value is an error.
- `!param { key: NAME, default: V }` — **optional**; falls back to `V`.
- `!param NAME` — bare-string shorthand for `!param { key: NAME }`.
- Map form: `{ param: { key: NAME, default: V } }`.

Placeholders are substituted on the untyped document *before* it is typed, so a
param can stand in anywhere — including where a number is required.

`--params` is a `,`-separated list of terms, exactly like `--series` (and itself
repeatable): `NAME=value` sets one, `@file.yml` loads a whole
`NAME: value` mapping. Terms apply left-to-right, so a later one wins. A
`NAME=value` value is parsed as a scalar (so `FAST=5` is a number, `SYM=BTC`
a string).

```sh
fugazi run @strategy.params.yml \
  --params @params.yml,FAST=5 \
  --series @candles.csv --output-dir out/
```

## Reusing signals — YAML anchors

A signal or level that appears in more than one place can be defined once with
a YAML anchor (`&name`) and reused elsewhere with an alias (`*name`). Anchors
are a native YAML feature — the parser inlines each alias with the anchored
subtree before typed deserialization, so the strategy sees exactly the same
tree it would have without the anchors.

The one YAML rule is that `*name` must appear **after** `&name` in the
document. The natural pattern is to attach the anchor at the first use site —
the earliest field that references the subtree — and alias it from every
later site:

```yaml
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter: &cross_up !crosses_above { lhs: !sma { period: 3 }, rhs: !sma { period: 8 } }
  exit:  &cross_dn !crosses_below { lhs: !sma { period: 3 }, rhs: !sma { period: 8 } }
short:
  enter: *cross_dn
  exit:  *cross_up
```

Anchors compose with `!param`: the parser inlines aliases first, so a `!param`
inside an anchored subtree is substituted at every reuse site in the same pass.

## Complete examples

An RSI mean-reversion, long/flat:

```yaml
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter: !crosses_above { lhs: !rsi { period: 14 }, rhs: !value 30 }  # cross up out of oversold
  exit:  !above         { source: !rsi { period: 14 }, level: 70 }    # leave on overbought
```

A Donchian breakout, always-in:

```yaml
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter: !crosses_above { lhs: close, rhs: !donchian_upper { period: 20 } }
short:
  enter: !crosses_below { lhs: close, rhs: !donchian_lower { period: 20 } }
```

The same SMA crossover as a one-line inline (flow-style) spec — tags work inside
flow mappings too, so this is handy as an inline `<STRATEGY>` positional literal
(`fugazi run '…'`):

```yaml
{ symbol: ETH, long: { enter: !crosses_above { lhs: !sma { period: 5 }, rhs: !sma { period: 20 } } } }
```

See [`examples/strategy.yml`](../examples/strategy.yml) for an annotated
SMA-crossover strategy and [`examples/strategy.params.yml`](../examples/strategy.params.yml)
for its parameterised version.
