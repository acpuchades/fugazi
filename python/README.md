# fugazi (Python)

Python bindings for [`fugazi`](..), a library of **incremental**,
**composable** technical-analysis primitives.

- **Incremental** — every indicator and signal carries its own state and is
  advanced one sample at a time with `update()`, in ~O(1) and with no
  full-history recomputation. The same object serves live streaming and batch
  backtesting.
- **Composable** — indicators own their input source, so you build complex
  indicators and signals by **nesting constructors**. There is no pipe or glue
  step: an "EMA of an SMA of the close" is literally `ta.ema(ta.sma(ta.close(),
  10), 20)`, and a trade condition is a single object you can feed bars.

## Install

```sh
pip install fugazi
```

Then `import fugazi`. Prebuilt wheels are published for Linux, macOS
(Intel + Apple Silicon) and Windows.

To build from a checkout instead (for development):

```sh
pip install maturin
maturin develop --release   # editable install into the active virtualenv
```

## Quick start

You build indicators by **nesting constructors**. Every indicator is rooted at
a leaf source — usually a candle field (`close()`, `high()`, `volume()`, ...):

```python
import fugazi as ta

ema = ta.ema(ta.close(), 20)                  # EMA-20 of the close
node = ta.ema(ta.sma(ta.close(), 10), 20)     # EMA-20 of an SMA-10 — just keep nesting
```

The root decides what the indicator *consumes*. A candle-rooted indicator takes
`Candle`s (any of OHLCV); to work on a **bare stream of numbers** instead, root
it at `identity()` — the leaf that passes raw values straight through:

```python
prices = ta.rsi(ta.identity(), 14)            # RSI of a plain float series
```

Then drive it one of two ways: **streaming** (a bar at a time) or **batch** (a
whole series at once). They share the same indicators; pick by how your data
arrives.

What you feed `update()`/`feed()` follows from the root: a candle-rooted
indicator consumes **candles**, an `identity()`-rooted one consumes **plain
numbers**.

### Streaming API — one sample at a time

Feed one sample to `update()`; it returns a `float`, or `None` until warmed up.
This is the live/incremental path. Every node also has `value()` (or `is_true()` for a boolean Signal),
`is_ready()`, and `reset()`.

```python
node = ta.ema(ta.sma(ta.close(), 10), 20)        # candle-rooted

for o, h, l, c, v in bars:
    value = node.update(ta.Candle(o, h, l, c, v))   # feed a Candle -> float | None
    print(value)

prices = ta.rsi(ta.identity(), 14)               # identity-rooted
for px in [100.0, 101.5, 100.8]:
    prices.update(px)                            # feed a float
```

### Batch API — a whole series at once

`feed(data)` computes every bar in one call. For a **candle-rooted** indicator,
`data` is a dataframe with OHLCV columns — **pandas and polars both work** (also
a `dict` of columns) — and only the columns an indicator needs have to be
present:

```python
import pandas as pd      # or: import polars as pl

# df is your OHLCV frame (open/high/low/close/volume columns)
df["ema20"] = ta.ema(ta.close(), 20).feed(df)   # assigns straight back
ta.atr(14).feed(df)                             # uses high/low/close
ta.vwap(20).feed(df)                            # uses high/low/close/volume
```

Column names are matched case-insensitively (`Close`/`CLOSE`/`close`), and
`close` is required. An **`identity()`-rooted** indicator instead takes a plain
1-D series — a `list`, NumPy array, or pandas/polars `Series`:

```python
ta.ema(ta.identity(), 20).feed([100.0, 101.5, 100.8, 102.3, 101.9])
ta.ema(ta.identity(), 20).feed(df["close"])
```

(The root is the contract: a candle indicator won't silently treat a bare array
as the close, and a value indicator won't accept a frame — pick the root that
matches your data.)

The output **mirrors the input library**, one value per bar, with warm-up bars
as `NaN` (so the result lines up with your rows and assigns straight back):

| Input | Indicator | Multi-line (macd, bollinger, …) | Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pandas | `Series` (index preserved) | `DataFrame` (one column per line) | bool `Series` |
| polars | `Series` | `DataFrame` | bool `Series` |
| list / dict / NumPy | `ndarray` | `dict` of `ndarray`s | bool `ndarray` |

```python
ta.ema(ta.close(), 20).feed(df)            # pandas Series, df.index
ta.macd(ta.close()).feed(df)               # pandas DataFrame: macd/signal/histogram
ta.macd(ta.identity()).feed(prices_list)   # {"macd": ndarray, "signal": ndarray, ...}
```

(If NumPy isn't installed, list/dict input falls back to plain Python lists.)

`feed` is **itself incremental** — it just loops `update` over the batch through
the node's own state and never auto-resets. So calling it on successive chunks
continues the same stream: the warm-up is paid once, and the concatenated
outputs equal a single feed over the whole series. This is what lets you process
data as it arrives without recomputing history:

```python
node = ta.sma(ta.identity(), 3)
x1 = node.feed(series1)         # warms up, emits for series1
x2 = node.feed(series2)         # continues from where series1 left off
# np.concatenate([x1, x2]) == ta.sma(ta.identity(), 3).feed(series1 + series2)

node.reset()                   # call reset() to start a fresh, independent pass
```

> A source can be reused after you pass it into a constructor:
>
> ```python
> src = ta.close()
> fast = ta.ema(src, 10)
> slow = ta.ema(src, 20)   # `src` is still usable here
> ```

## Indicators

| Constructor | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `open() high() low() close() volume() typical() median()` | the candle field |
| `identity()` | the raw value stream (root for a bare numeric series) |
| `value(x)` | a constant |
| `sma ema rma wma hma rsi stddev stochastic cci (source, period)` | a value |
| `skewness kurtosis zscore (source, period)` | a value (distribution shape / normalization; `kurtosis` is raw, ~3 for normal) |
| `correlation(lhs, rhs, period)` | rolling Pearson correlation in `[-1, 1]` (autocorrelation: `correlation(x, x.lag(n), period)`) |
| `variance_ratio(source, period, lag)` | Lo-MacKinlay regime classifier (`>1` trending, `<1` mean-reverting); O(period)/bar recompute |
| `stoch_rsi(source, rsi_period=14, stoch_period=14)` | a value |
| `atr mfi williams_r vwap (period)` | a value |
| `parkinson garman_klass rogers_satchell (period)` | range-based volatility estimate (uses the full candle; more efficient than close-to-close stddev) |
| `obv() ad() true_range()` | a value |
| `sar(step=0.02, max=0.2)` | a value |
| `macd(source, fast=12, slow=26, signal=9)` | dict `{macd, signal, histogram}` |
| `bollinger(source, period=20, k=2.0)` | dict `{upper, middle, lower}` |
| `keltner(source, ema_period=20, atr_period=10, multiplier=2.0)` | dict `{upper, middle, lower}` |
| `donchian(high, low, period)` | dict `{upper, middle, lower}` |
| `adx(period)` | dict `{plus_di, minus_di, adx}` |
| `dmi(period)` | dict `{plus_di, minus_di}` |
| `aroon(period)` | dict `{up, down, oscillator}` |
| `resample(every, inner)` | `inner`'s output every `every` bars (aggregated HTF candle fed to `inner`), `None` between |
| `latch(source)` | `source`'s last `Some` output, held across `None` ticks (works on indicators and signals) |
| `unstable(x)` | Passthrough that reports `unstable_period() = 0` for its subtree (also `.unstable()` on any Indicator or Signal) |

Multi-line indicators return a `dict` of their named lines (or `None` while
warming up).

### Projecting one line of a multi-output indicator: `shared()`

Call `.shared()` on any multi-output indicator (`macd`, `bollinger`, `adx`,
`donchian`, `keltner`, `dmi`, `aroon`) to get a handle whose per-line accessors
return ordinary `Indicator`s that compose with the usual operators (`gt`,
`crosses_above`, `add`, …). Every accessor built off one `.shared()` handle
projects into the **same** underlying source — the multi advances at most once
per bar however many accessors read out of it, exactly like Rust's
`Macd::new(...).shared()`:

```python
# MACD line crossing its signal line, as a single composed Signal:
macd = ta.macd(ta.close(), 12, 26, 9).shared()
bullish = macd.line().crosses_above(macd.signal())

# Close pierces the Bollinger upper band:
bands = ta.bollinger(ta.close(), 20, 2.0).shared()
breakout = ta.close().gt(bands.upper())
```

The accessor names mirror the Rust API: `line()`/`signal()`/`histogram()` on a
MACD, `upper()`/`middle()`/`lower()` on Bollinger/Keltner/Donchian,
`plus_di()`/`minus_di()`/`adx()` on ADX/DMI, `up()`/`down()`/`oscillator()` on
Aroon. `component(name)` is a programmatic fallback, `names()` lists what's
available for a given handle. Calling `.shared()` returns a fresh handle owning
its own copy of the source, so the original `MultiIndicator` (with its dict-
returning `.update()` / `.feed()` API) stays usable in parallel.

### Cross-timeframe composition

`resample` + `latch` compose a higher-timeframe pipeline over a base candle
stream: `resample(N, inner)` aggregates every N base candles into one HTF
candle and runs `inner` (any candle-rooted Real source — `close()`,
`ema(close(), 20)`, …) over it, emitting `inner`'s output on the completing
tick and `None` in between. **The resample's clock stays base-timeframe**:
it's fed one base candle per `update()` and reports at that same cadence —
the emitted output marks whether the inner produced a value on a completed
bucket. Wrap the whole resample in `latch()` so per-base-tick reads see the
finished value between boundaries.

```python
# EMA-20 of the closes of every 4-bar candle, latched for per-base-tick reads.
htf_ema = ta.latch(ta.resample(4, ta.ema(ta.close(), 20)))
```

The **only correct ordering** is `resample(N, ema(...))` — with the recursive
smoother as the resample's `inner` — then `latch` on the outside; latching
*before* the recursive smoother would feed it a held (repeated) value on every
base tick, distorting the recurrence.

`unstable(x)` wraps an indicator or signal as a passthrough that reports
`unstable_period() = 0`, telling a downstream reader of `stable_period()`
(a strategy-readiness gate, an overlay trim) "trade through this subtree's
IIR settling tail". Available as a free function and as a method on any
Indicator or Signal — same output, same warm-up, only the reported unstable
tail changes:

```python
raw = ta.ema(ta.close(), 20)
fast = raw.unstable()           # method form; unstable_period() -> 0
fast = ta.unstable(raw)         # equivalent free-function form
```

Safe by default, override per subtree: fugazi's readiness machinery waits for
`stable_period()` by default (`SingleAssetStrategy::is_ready` in Rust; the
CLI's per-overlay CSV trim in `fugazi get`) — `unstable(...)` is the single
opt-out.

### Cross-asset composition — `Snapshot`, `Selector`, and `pick(...)`

To reason about more than one asset per bar, feed a **Snapshot** — a keyed
collection of `Atom`s (one per asset for the current bar) — and use `pick(...)`
to project one asset out of it. Every atom-input leaf (`close()`, `high()`,
`atr()`, `year()`, `is_weekday()`, ...) takes an optional `source=` argument
that re-roots it onto a `pick(...)`, so cross-asset expressions compose from
the same primitives as single-asset ones:

```python
import fugazi as ta

# BTC's close as a first-class indicator over Snapshot input.
btc_close = ta.close(source=ta.pick("BTC"))

# BTC/ETH close spread — arithmetic between two picks is just an indicator.
spread = ta.close(ta.pick("BTC")) - ta.close(ta.pick("ETH"))

# Feed one snapshot per bar.
snap = ta.Snapshot({
    "BTC": ta.Atom(ta.Candle(100, 101, 99, 100, 1), time=1_710_504_000_000),
    "ETH": ta.Atom(ta.Candle(60, 61, 59, 60, 1),   time=1_710_504_000_000),
})
print(spread.update(snap))          # -> 40.0
```

Snapshot keys are **Selectors** — a `(symbol?, freq?)` pair. A `Selector`
matches structurally: a `None` field on the query wildcards the corresponding
storage field, so `pick(symbol="BTC")` finds every BTC entry regardless of
frequency. A bare Python `str` is coerced to `Selector.by_symbol(...)`, a
`(str, Frequency|str)` tuple to a full `(symbol, freq)` pair, so most call
sites don't need to reach for `Selector` explicitly. Cross-frequency indexes
disambiguate by giving both fields:

```python
snap = ta.Snapshot({
    ("BTC", "1h"): ta.Atom(ta.Candle(100, 101, 99, 100, 1), time=1_710_504_000_000),
    ("BTC", "1d"): ta.Atom(ta.Candle(90, 105, 88, 102, 1),  time=1_710_504_000_000),
    ("ETH", "1h"): ta.Atom(ta.Candle(60, 61, 59, 60, 1),    time=1_710_504_000_000),
})
btc_hourly = ta.close(ta.pick(symbol="BTC", freq="1h"))
any_hourly = ta.close(ta.pick(freq="1h"))              # wildcard on symbol
assert btc_hourly.update(snap) == 100.0
```

**Snapshot behaves like a dict of atoms**: `snap[selector]`, `snap[selector] =
atom`, `selector in snap`, `len(snap)`, `snap.keys()`. Constructors accept a
plain Python mapping, and `update()` accepts either a `Snapshot` or a bare
dict (lifted on the fly), so the surface fits both "build the frame once" and
"hand a fresh dict per bar" styles.

A `pick(...)` is *atom-emitting*, not real-emitting: it feeds any atom-input
leaf via `source=`. Compositions preserve the input domain — the arithmetic
below still consumes snapshots — and mixing a snapshot-rooted indicator with
a candle-rooted one is a `TypeError` (a candle-input and a snapshot-input
can't share a bar).

```python
# Any atom-input leaf takes source=: the price accessors and every calendar
# reader, wired to the same picked atom stream.
btc_close = ta.close(source=ta.pick("BTC"))
btc_year  = ta.year(source=ta.pick("BTC"))
ratio     = ta.close(ta.pick("BTC")) / ta.close(ta.pick("ETH"))
```

**The zero-arg `pick()` is the single-series shortcut.** With no query it
runs `Snapshot.sole_atom` on every bar: the snapshot must contain exactly one
entry (its atom is what the pick emits), otherwise the call **panics loudly**
(a Python `RuntimeError` translated from the Rust panic). That's the
"strategy authored for one asset but fed a `Snapshot`-shaped driver" case —
the loud failure catches multi-asset input that would otherwise silently pick
whichever entry the HashMap iterator happened to hand back.

```python
# Single-series strategy, snapshot-shaped input:
close = ta.close(source=ta.pick())
snap  = ta.Snapshot({"BTC": ta.Atom(ta.Candle(1, 1, 1, 42, 1))})
assert close.update(snap) == 42.0
```

**Atom equality is by `time`.** Two atoms compare equal iff their bar-open
`Timestamp`s match — the OHLCV numbers and overlays are payload, not identity —
and atoms sort chronologically (`None` first), so mixed streams can be
deduplicated by time and sorted into run order without a custom key:

```python
a1 = ta.Atom(ta.Candle(1, 1, 1, 1, 0), time=1_000)
a2 = ta.Atom(ta.Candle(1, 1, 1, 99, 0), time=1_000)   # different price
a3 = ta.Atom(ta.Candle(1, 1, 1, 1, 0), time=2_000)
assert a1 == a2 and a1 < a3
assert len({a1, a2, a3}) == 2                          # a1 == a2, distinct from a3
```

## Operators

Combine value indicators into **other indicators**:

```python
ta.close().add(other)        # also: sub, mul, div  — or the + - * / operators
ta.close().lag(1)            # also: diff, ratio, roc
ta.close().rolling_max(20)   # also: rolling_min
```

...or into **signals** (booleans):

```python
fast.gt(slow)                        # also: lt, ge, le, eq, ne  (optional epsilon=...)
ta.rsi(ta.close(), 14).above(70.0)   # also: below(level)
fast.crosses_above(slow)             # also: crosses_below
```

Signals compose with each other and update to a `bool`:

```python
sig = a.and_(b)     # also: or_, xor_, not_(), changed()  — or  a & b | ~c
sig.update(candle)  # -> bool
```

## Example

"Fast EMA crosses above slow EMA while RSI is not already overbought" — one
signal, usable either way:

```python
import fugazi as ta

def golden():
    return (
        ta.ema(ta.close(), 12)
          .crosses_above(ta.ema(ta.close(), 26))
          .and_(ta.rsi(ta.close(), 14).below(70.0))
    )

# streaming: react bar by bar
signal = golden()
for bar in stream:
    if signal.update(bar):
        print("entry signal")

# batch: a boolean Series/array over the whole frame
entries = golden().feed(df)
```

## Trading: the wallet

The strategy layer is exposed two ways. For the classic single-asset shape
there's a declarative **`Strategy`** builder you `run` over a wallet (below);
for anything else, the **wallet** is a market-agnostic venue you trade into with
your own per-bar Python — no class to subclass. `PaperWallet` is the built-in,
in-memory book (funds + positions + a trade blotter); live execution belongs in
your own code, not here.

```python
import fugazi as ta

wallet = ta.PaperWallet(10_000.0)          # seed with cash

wallet.update("AAPL", 185.0)               # feed the price each tick (before trading)

# set: absolute target (opposite side reverses) · set_position: absolute units · close: flat
wallet.set("AAPL", "buy", 10)                       # target 10 units (a number = units)
wallet.set("AAPL", "buy", ta.Size.value_frac(0.25)) # target 25% of equity
wallet.set("AAPL", "buy", ta.Size.position_frac(0.5))  # trim to 50% of the position
wallet.set_position("AAPL", 4)                      # drive straight to 4 units
wallet.close("AAPL")                                # flatten

wallet.funds                 # cash balance
wallet.position("AAPL")      # signed position (negative = short)
wallet.price("AAPL")         # last fed price (or None)
wallet.positions()           # {symbol: units}
wallet.equity()              # funds + positions marked at the fed prices
wallet.orders()              # the blotter: list of Order(symbol, side, units)
```

The wallet is fed each symbol's price with `update(symbol, price)` and is
otherwise market-agnostic. Sizes are an absolute number of units, or
`ta.Size.funds_frac(f)` (cash) / `ta.Size.value_frac(f)` (equity; `1.0` is
all-in) / `ta.Size.position_frac(f)`; sides are `"buy"`/`"sell"`. A movement that
can't be carried out — no/zero price fed, or a buy beyond available funds —
raises `ValueError`. A full strategy loop — price the wallet, advance **every**
signal each bar, then act:

```python
enter = ta.sma(ta.close(), 3).crosses_above(ta.sma(ta.close(), 10))
exit_ = ta.sma(ta.close(), 3).crosses_below(ta.sma(ta.close(), 10))
wallet = ta.PaperWallet(10_000.0)

for o, h, l, c, v in bars:
    candle = ta.Candle(o, h, l, c, v)
    wallet.update("AAPL", c)                          # price the wallet
    went_long, went_flat = enter.update(candle), exit_.update(candle)
    if went_long:
        wallet.set("AAPL", "buy", ta.Size.value_frac(1.0))   # all-in long
    elif went_flat:
        wallet.close("AAPL")
```

### The declarative `Strategy` builder

For the classic long/flat/short shape, skip the hand-written loop: wire
entry/exit signals (and an optional sizing multiplier) onto a `Strategy` and
`run` it over a `PaperWallet`. You get back a `RunReport` — the per-bar equity
curve and the fill blotter — that the [metrics](#metrics) functions reduce to
numbers.

```python
import fugazi as ta
from fugazi.metrics import per_bar_returns, sharpe

enter = ta.sma(ta.close(), 3).crosses_above(ta.sma(ta.close(), 10))
exit_ = ta.sma(ta.close(), 3).crosses_below(ta.sma(ta.close(), 10))

strat = (
    ta.Strategy("AAPL")
    .long_on(enter, exit_)             # long/flat; add .short_on(down, up) for always-in
    .position_sizing(ta.value(0.5))    # optional: half-position (Kelly / vol-target fit here too)
)

prices = [10, 11, 12, 11, 10, 12, 14, 16, 15, 13, 15, 17, 19, 18]
ohlcv = {
    "open": prices,
    "high": [p + 1 for p in prices],
    "low": [p - 1 for p in prices],
    "close": prices,
    "volume": [1000.0] * len(prices),
}

wallet = ta.PaperWallet(10_000.0)
report = strat.run(wallet, ohlcv)      # a pandas/polars DataFrame or an OHLCV dict

report.equity_curve                    # one marked-to-market value per bar
report.fills                           # list[Fill] — the blotter, in fill order
rets = per_bar_returns(report.equity_curve, report.initial_equity)
sharpe(rets, 0.0, 252.0)
```

The builder mirrors Rust's `SingleAssetStrategy`: `long_on` / `short_on` (a
missing `exit` never fires — right for an always-in reversal), `position_sizing`
(scales the value-fraction magnitude; a `None` reading skips that bar's trade),
and the strategy's book is seeded to the wallet's opening equity. Signals must be
candle- or snapshot-rooted (a bare-value signal is rejected). Not bound yet:
position-anchored protective stops, pairs / basket strategies, and the Rust
recipe catalogue — drop to the wallet loop above for those.

## YAML strategy specs — `load_spec`, `optimize`, walkforward

The CLI's YAML surface (see the crate root's `strategy.yml` examples) is
available natively from Python. `ta.load_spec(text)` parses a spec
document, auto-detects its shape (single / pairs / basket / multi /
portfolio), and returns a `StrategySpec` that implements the same
`.run(wallet, snapshots)` interface as the manual [`Strategy`](#the-declarative-strategy-builder)
builder. `.evaluate(...)` is a bonus method that runs + reduces to a metrics
dict in one call.

```python
import fugazi as ta

spec = ta.load_spec("""
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter: !crosses_above
    lhs: !sma { period: 3 }
    rhs: !sma { period: 10 }
""")
assert spec.kind == "single"

snaps = [
    ta.Snapshot({"BTC": ta.Candle(v, v, v, v, 1.0)})
    for v in [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22, 21, 20, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6]
]
wallet = ta.PaperWallet(1000.0)
report = spec.run(wallet, snaps)              # -> RunReport
metrics = spec.evaluate(ta.PaperWallet(1000.0), snaps)  # -> nested dict mirroring metrics.yml
```

Preset tags (`!buy_and_hold`, `!ma_crossover`, `!rsi_reversal`,
`!donchian_breakout`, `!keltner_breakout`) work directly:

```python
spec = ta.load_spec("!buy_and_hold { symbol: BTC }")
```

The five shapes are auto-detected by top-level YAML key:

| Top-level key(s)        | Detected kind |
| ---                     | ---           |
| `children:`             | `portfolio`   |
| `left:` + `right:`      | `pairs`       |
| `selection:`            | `basket`      |
| `symbol:` or preset tag | `single`      |
| (bare mapping)          | `multi`       |

Pass `kind="single"` / `"pairs"` / ... to override detection, and
`params={"NAME": value}` to fill `!param` placeholders in the document.

### Parameter-grid optimize

`ta.optimize(text, snapshots, ...)` sweeps a parameter grid, ranks rows by
`--best-by`-style metric, and returns a `Sweep`:

```python
spec_yaml = """
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter: !crosses_above
    lhs: !sma { period: !param FAST }
    rhs: !sma { period: !param SLOW }
"""
opt_snaps = [
    ta.Snapshot({"BTC": ta.Candle(v, v, v, v, 1.0)})
    for v in [100 + i * 0.5 for i in range(40)]
]

sweep = ta.optimize(
    spec_yaml,
    opt_snaps,
    cash=1000.0,
    grid=[{"FAST": [3, 5, 7], "SLOW": [10, 15]}],
    metric_names=["risk_adjusted.sharpe", "returns.total_pct"],
    best_by="risk_adjusted.sharpe",
)
sweep.columns          # -> ["FAST", "SLOW"]
sweep.rows[0].values   # -> {"FAST": 3, "SLOW": 10}
sweep.rows[0].metrics  # -> {"risk_adjusted.sharpe": ..., "returns.total_pct": ...}
sweep.best             # -> highest-ranked row (None when best_by is unset)
```

`grid` is a list of dicts (one per subgrid; stacked subgrids union), where
values that are lists become sweep axes and `"start..end[:step]"` strings
expand to numeric ranges. Pass `windowed=N` to reduce each grid point across
non-overlapping N-bar windows (`row.metrics_windowed` carries the per-window
docs), or `walkforward=(is, oos)` / `walkforward=(is, oos, embargo)` for
walk-forward validation:

```python
wf_yaml = """
symbol: BTC
long:
  enter: !crosses_above
    lhs: !sma { period: !param FAST }
    rhs: !sma { period: 15 }
"""
wf_snaps = [
    ta.Snapshot({"BTC": ta.Candle(v, v, v, v, 1.0)})
    for v in [100 + i * 0.5 for i in range(40)]
]

result = ta.optimize(
    wf_yaml,
    wf_snaps,
    cash=1000.0,
    grid=[{"FAST": [3, 5]}],
    best_by="risk_adjusted.sharpe",
    walkforward=(5, 3),
)
# -> WalkForwardResult with per-fold IS/OOS metrics + composite OOS equity
for fold in result.folds:
    fold.is_range, fold.oos_range     # bar ranges
    fold.values                         # winning params for that fold
    fold.is_metrics, fold.oos_metrics   # nested metrics dicts
result.composite_equity                 # stitched OOS curve
result.composite_metrics                # composite metrics doc
```

### Costs

Trading costs load from a Python dict matching the CLI's YAML shape
(externally-tagged models: `!percentage`, `!bps`, `!volume_participation`, …):

```python
costs = ta.TradingCostsConfig({
    "commission": {"percentage": {"rate": 0.001}},
    "spread":     {"bps": {"bps": 5}},
})
cost_yaml = "!buy_and_hold { symbol: BTC }"
cost_snaps = [
    ta.Snapshot({"BTC": ta.Candle(v, v, v, v, 1.0)})
    for v in [100, 101, 102, 103, 104]
]
sweep = ta.optimize(cost_yaml, cost_snaps, cash=1000.0, grid=[{}], costs=costs)
```

Per-symbol / per-interval overrides use the same shape as the CLI:

```python
costs = ta.TradingCostsConfig({
    "commission": {
        "default": {"percentage": {"rate": 0.001}},
        "by_symbol": {"BTC": {"percentage": {"rate": 0.0005}}},
    }
})
```

`costs=` accepts either a `TradingCostsConfig` or a raw dict on `ta.optimize(...)`.
For `.run(wallet, snapshots)` and `.evaluate(wallet, snapshots)`, costs come
from what's pre-installed on the wallet (matching how the manual
[`Strategy`](#the-declarative-strategy-builder) builder works).

## Metrics

`fugazi.metrics` is the standalone reporting surface — one function per metric
so you pick only what you need. Return moments (`mean_return`, `stddev_return`,
`skewness`, `value_at_risk`, …), risk-adjusted ratios (`sharpe`, `sortino`,
`calmar`, `omega`, `ulcer_performance_index`), drawdown analytics
(`max_drawdown`, `average_drawdown`, `time_in_drawdown_ratio`,
`recovery_factor`), and round-trip trade statistics (`win_rate`,
`profit_factor`, `expectancy`, `kelly_fraction`, `average_bars_held`, …) are all
there. Values are in **natural units** — `0.15` is +15%, not `15.0` — and
ratios that can vanish (zero variance for Sharpe, no losing trade for a profit
factor, non-positive endpoints for CAGR) return `None` rather than `NaN`.

Three intermediate builders — `per_bar_returns`, `reconstruct_trades`,
`drawdown_segments` — turn the equity curve and fill blotter into what the
metric functions consume, so a caller computing several metrics builds each
intermediate once:

```python
from fugazi import metrics

equity = [10_000.0, 10_050.0, 10_100.0, 9_900.0, 10_200.0, 10_300.0]
returns = metrics.per_bar_returns(equity, initial_equity=10_000.0)

metrics.sharpe(returns, risk_free_rate=0.0, bars_per_year=252)   # ratio | None
metrics.total_return(equity, initial_equity=10_000.0)            # 0.03
metrics.max_drawdown(metrics.drawdown_segments(equity))          # fraction
```

`reconstruct_trades` walks a bar-tagged fill blotter with a signed position and
a volume-weighted entry, producing one `Trade` per closed leg. Since
`PaperWallet.update()` returns bare `Order`s (no bar), tag each with the bar
you're on using `fugazi.Fill(bar, order)` as you drive the loop:

```python
from fugazi import metrics

fills = []
wallet = ta.PaperWallet(10_000.0)
wallet.update("AAPL", candles[0])          # prime with a price for pre-flight
wallet.set_position("AAPL", 100.0)         # queued market buy
for i, c in enumerate(candles):
    for order in wallet.update("AAPL", c):
        fills.append(ta.Fill(bar=i, order=order))

trades = metrics.reconstruct_trades(fills)
metrics.win_rate(trades)                   # win fraction | None
metrics.profit_factor(trades)              # Σwins / |Σlosses| | None
metrics.exposure_ratio(fills, total_bars=len(candles))
```

## Fetching data

Two remote candle providers ship built in — `Binance` (crypto spot klines) and
`Yahoo` (stocks, ETFs, indices, FX). Each is a client class with one method,
`candles(...)`, returning a `polars`/`pandas` `DataFrame` (or a `dict` of lists
with `output="numpy"`):

```python
import fugazi as ta

binance = ta.Binance()                     # public endpoint, defaults
df = binance.candles(symbol="BTCUSDT", freq="1d",
                     since="2020-01-01", until="today")

yahoo = ta.Yahoo()
df = yahoo.candles(symbol="AAPL", freq="1d", since="2020-01-01")
```

`freq` is a bar-cadence token (`"1m"`/`"5m"`/`"1h"`/`"4h"`/`"1d"`/`"1w"`/`"1M"`);
`since`/`until` accept ISO (`"YYYY-MM-DD"`), EU (`"D-M-YYYY"`), or relative
(`"today"`, `"yesterday"`, `"Nd ago"`, `"Nw ago"`) dates, `until` is exclusive
and defaults to now. The returned frame has `time` (ISO 8601 UTC), `open`,
`high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, and — carried through from each provider's
own API — Binance's `quote_volume`, `n_trades`, `taker_buy_base_volume`,
`taker_buy_quote_volume`; Yahoo's `adj_close` (split- and dividend-adjusted).

`fugazi.fetch(provider=..., symbol=..., ...)` is the provider-generic form of
the same call — handy when the provider name is itself a variable:

```python
df = ta.fetch(provider="yfinance", symbol="AAPL", freq="1d", since="2020-01-01")
```

### Overlay data (no OHLCV)

`CoinGecko` is a different shape of provider: it returns data that is a property
of an asset at a point in time — market capitalisation, traded volume, supply —
rather than a price bar. So it has `overlays(...)` instead of `candles(...)`, and
the frame it returns has **no `open`/`high`/`low`/`close`**:

```python
cg = ta.CoinGecko()                        # public endpoint; COINGECKO_API_KEY if set
caps = cg.overlays(symbol="bitcoin", freq="1d", since="30d ago")
# columns: time, price, market_cap, total_volume, circulating_supply
```

`symbol` is a CoinGecko **coin id** (`"bitcoin"`, not `"BTC"` and not `"BTCUSDT"`);
`cg.ids()` lists the vocabulary. `circulating_supply` is derived as
`market_cap / price`. To use these alongside prices, join the two frames on
`time` — market cap and supply are not derivable from OHLCV at all, which is the
whole reason the provider exists.

Two limits of the public tier: it serves only the **last 365 days** (a wider
`since` raises `ValueError`), and sub-hourly frequencies are rejected, because
CoinGecko only samples that finely over windows too short to backtest on.
`ta.fetch(provider="cg", ...)` deliberately raises rather than returning a
candle-less frame from a function named `fetch`.

`CoinMarketCap` is the same overlay shape, backed by CMC's historical-quotes
endpoint — **a paid-tier feature**, so it needs an API key from a paid plan
(`CMC_PRO_API_KEY`, or `api_key=`); without one the API answers `402`/`401`:

```python
cmc = ta.CoinMarketCap()                    # api_key= or CMC_PRO_API_KEY
caps = cmc.overlays(symbol="BTC", freq="1d", since="30d ago")
# columns: time, price, volume_24h, market_cap, circulating_supply, total_supply
```

`symbol` is a CMC **ticker** (`"BTC"`) or a **numeric id** (`"1"`); `cmc.ids()`
lists the tickers. Unlike CoinGecko, CMC honours an explicit `interval`, so it
fetches the requested cadence directly; `circulating_supply` falls back to
`market_cap / price` on any bar CMC doesn't report it. As with CoinGecko,
`ta.fetch(provider="cmc", ...)` raises rather than returning a
candle-less frame.
